This is my iteration on Kaggle's Titanic challenge (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic).
The .csv files in the data folder belong entirely to Kaggle and I do not have any ownership over them.

I wrote the following models:
- dataTrain.py : Using the standard Random Forest Classifier;
- linearTrain.py : Using logistic regression;
- neuralTrain.py : Using pytorch neural networks.
